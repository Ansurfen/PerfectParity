## Don't Wait
I was sick of Mojang changing and breaking so many mods every update. I wanted to play with my modpack but didn't want to wait for the new features. So this mod asks "Why not both?".

Unlike many backport mods, this does not aim to backport between major versions (Ex 1.21 -> 1.20). This is a minor version backport mod. Most mods are on 1.21.1 and 1.21.4. I do not think it's fair to choose between new features and mods.

![Perfect Parity 1.21.5](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/131974b55e4b2734a1a6f6f8733a219a4b37fa77.png)

✅ Added Bush block

❌ Added new falling leaf particles to all Leaves blocks

- [Falling Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleaves) adds (as the name implies) falling
    leaves that look better than Mojang's IMO
    
✅ Added new ambient block sounds in the Desert and Badlands biomes

### Compatibility

In theory, compatible with everything. If you find an issue, [let me know](https://github.com/timelord1102/PerfectParity/issues)

For Tectonic, use the 1.21.5 version

Other data packs, default to 1.21.4

Should be compatible with all 1.21.5 resource packs
